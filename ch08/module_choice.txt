1 Configuring SSH on Ubuntu
The best answer I could see is https://forge.puppet.com/modules/ghoneycutt/ssh
It is the most popular and is approved while https://forge.puppet.com/modules/simp/ssh does not support ubuntu and other modules had not been recently updated

2 Installing and configuring IIS
The best answer I could see is https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/iis
It is most popular, recently released and supported

3 Configuring the time zone using DSC on a Windows machine
This is where you have to be careful with DSC modules they automatically wrap everything available in Powershell gallery and seeing xtimezone you might assume this would work but at https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/xTimeZone/1.8.0.0

You see the following

 Release Notes
* THIS MODULE HAS BEEN DEPRECATED. It will no longer be released. Please use the "TimeZone" resource in ComputerManagementDsc instead.

So the answer is https://forge.puppet.com/modules/dsc/computermanagementdsc

4 Install and configure logstash
https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppet/logstash is approved and most recently released
